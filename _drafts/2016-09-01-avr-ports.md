After getting a pushbutton to send a single key event to the computer, my next goal was to wire up a few more "keys" in the way an actual keyboard circuit would be laid out. I had huge amounts of trouble getting simple thinkgs working, like turning on pins, so it didn't take long before I realized that I actually had no idea how all the macros provided by LUFA worked. So I went and did some reading on how pins on AVRs actually work.


## Arduino And The ATmega328p

My first experience with microcontrollers was, like many people, with an Arduino Uno. Arduino is an open source prototyping platform that makes it easy to get started with hardware projects. They provide their own IDE and C-like programming language to program the boards. *Hello World!* with Arduino or other hardware projects is generally blinking an LED, because what better way is there to say hello to the world than flashing a bright light in its face? Hello world would in Arduino would look like this:

```
void setup() {
  // Initialize digital pin 13 as an output.
  // Assume our LED's anode is connected to this pin.
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
  delay(1000);
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);
  delay(1000);
}
```

... And that's it! It's all pretty self-documenting even without comments. It almost reads like English: First we set up our hardware by setting pin 13 to output mode; then we go into the loop, set pin 13 to high - turning the LED on, wait 1000ms, set pin 13 to low - turning the LED off, wait 1000ms, then loop forever. Simple!

After digging around, I found a similar example program in pure C that uses the LUFA framework. This was the first program I flashed to my ATmega32u4:

```
int main() {
  DDRB = _BV(PB0);

  while(1) {
	PORTB ^= _BV(PB0);
	sleep(1000);
  }
}
```

... While I instinctively knew what this program was supposed to do, I still had no idea what I was looking at. Obviously, we're doing some setup, and then going into a loop to toggle the LED on and off, but what do all these capital letters mean? Are they supposed to be macros or something? 
Short answer: Yes.
Long answer:


## AVR Ports

Arduino is great because it takes a lot of the esoteric aspects of microcontroller programming and makes it very obvious what you're doing. The problem is that this gave me a false understanding of how pins on an AVR actually work.

I started by looking at pinout for the ATmega32u4:

![alt text](/assets/32U4PinMapping.png "ATmega32u4 pinout")

In my case, PB0 seems to connected to the LED on my Pro Micro which seems to make sense as that pin also seems to have an Arduino function of RXLED. Neat. I tried modifying the code to work with other pins too, connecting an LED to the appropriate pin. `PB1` was fine, `PD4` also good. Keeping in mind the keyboard, I knew that I would need to set a bunch of pins as inputs and cycle through outputs to create a scanning matrix (More on that in a later post). The point is, I would need to source voltage from one pin to another, checking its state to see if a switch had been pressed. I found some example code for setting a pin as an input:

```
// Set PB0 as an input, and the rest as outputs
DDRB = ~_BV(PB0);

// Set PB0 and PB1 as inputs, and the rest as outputs
DDRB = ~(_BV(PB0) | _BV(PB1));

// Read the state of PB0
variable = (PINB & _BV(PB0));
```

I still wasn't super sure about what was going on, other than that it looked like the code was doing some bitwise logic. Digging around, I found a GitHub repo where the author was doing something similar. Here's an excerpt of his keypress checking:

```
// In keypad.h
#define PB_4_BIT     4

//
#include "keypad.h"

// ...

if (!((1<<PB_8_BIT)&PINB))
  KeyboardReport->KeyCode[UsedKeyCodes++] = HID_KEYBOARD_SC_KEYPAD_8_AND_UP_ARROW;

```

So it's looking like he's got some actual bit shifting going on here. It goes without saying that that if statement could be written `if (!((1<<4)&PINB))`. Clearly the `_BV(PB0)` in my code was somehow related to this bit shifting. I changed my code up a bit:

```
int main() {
  DDRB = 1<<0;

  while(1) {
	PORTB ^= 1<<0;
	sleep(1000);
  }
}
```

... And the LED was still happily blinking away.
After trying this out with a few other values, it became pretty obvious that somewhere in a header file, this line of code must exist:

```
#define _BV(N) 1<<N
```

Now, I'm going to be honest. I've been using Java and other C-like languages for a good number of years, but having only ever done bit shifting in job interviews, it really wasn't very obvious to me what this was doing.

## There are 10 types of people...

I continued looking for the "correct" way to initialize my pins to do what I wanted. I came across yet another way to initialize the pins. The next lines are probably incredibly obvious to the reader, yet I somehow didn't understand until I saw the following:

```
// Initialize PB0 as an output
DDRB = 0b00000001
```

Pins available as inputs or outputs exist on ports, with the pins being labeled `Pxn` where:

```
x is the letter identifying the port
n is the number of a specific pin on that port
```

This is where my understanding of controlling pins in Arduino didn't quite map to how pins work when programming for AVRs directly. 
On Arduino, where you might write:

```
digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
```

to mean "set pin 13's state to HIGH", when programming the AVR in C, one could use any one of the following:

```
PORTB = 0b00000001;
PORTB = 0x01;
PORTB = 1<<0;
PORTB = _BV(PB0);
```

to mean "Set the least significant bit on port B to 1"; that is "on".

In a similar way, one could turn on the 3rd pin on port D with:

```
PORTD = _BV(PD4);
```

You get the idea.

## Data Direction Register

After realizing that all I was doing with these macros was setting or unsetting bits, everything became easier to understand.

DDRx is the Data Direction Register on the AVR, where:

```
x is the port to be set (A, B, C, etc.)
```

Writing a 1 to a pin of a port will set that pin to be an output, while writing a 0 will set that pin as an input. Note that pins on a port can be configured independently of each other.

## Port Data Register

PORTx is the Port Data Register, where once again, x is the letter corresponding to the port you're setting.

For a pin configured as an output, writing 1 will set that pin to a high state; writing 0 will set that pin to low.

For a pin configured as an input, setting 1 will enable the pin's internal pull-up resistor. Writing 0 will disable it.

## Port Input Pins Register

PINx is the Port Input Pins Register.
This register is used to read the current state of input pins on PORTx. Reading the state of pins is generally done by doing a bitwise AND with the register.

For example, suppose I wanted to set up pins 3 and 4 on PORTB as inputs and then check the state of pin 3. An excerpt from a program doing this could look like the following:

```
// Strictly speaking, PB3 AND PB4 are already inputs by default
// This also sets all other pins on PORTB to outputs
DDRB = ~(_BV(PB3) & _BV(PB4));

// Turn on the pull-up resistors on PB3 and PB4, turn off all other outputs
PORTB = _BV(PB3) | _BV(PB4);

// Check the state of pin 3 on PORTB
uint8_t stateOfPinB = (PINB & _BV(PB3));
```

Going through each of the statements, we can see the bitwise operations that are happening:

```
DDRB = ~(_BV(PB3) & _BV(PB4));

_BV(PB3) = 1<<3 = 00000100
_BV(PB4) = 1<<4 = 00001000

  00000100
& 00001000
------------
~ 00001100
------------
  11110011

DDRB = 0b11110011
```

Setting outputs and PB3 and PB4's pull-up resistors:

```
PORTB = _BV(PB3) | _BV(PB4);

_BV(PB3) = 1<<3 = 00000100
_BV(PB4) = 1<<4 = 00001000

  00000100
& 00001000
------------
  00001100

PORTB = 00001100
```

Suppose the states of both pins were high. The very simple bitwise arithmetic we did while checking the state is:

```
stateOfPinB = (PINB & _BV(PB3));

PINB = 00001100
_BV(PB3)) = 00000100

  00001100
& 00000100
------------
  00000100
```

which is of course `8` in base 10, and evaluates to `true` as a `bool` in C.
