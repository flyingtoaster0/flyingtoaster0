For Ludum Dare 38, I made a short game in 72 hours in C# using the Monogame framework and Monocle game engine. The game itself is short platformer two levels long with Mega Man-style screen transitions. The project was a great opportunity for to see what the language can do, and to finally try my hand at drawing some pixel art. In the end, C# quickly became my new favorite language and I was really happy with what I accomplished in three days.
