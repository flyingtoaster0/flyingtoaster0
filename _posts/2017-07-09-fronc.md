Fronc is the name of an mobile data usage tracking app for a made up mobile carrier. This app was designed as a part of a project in a class at OCAD University. After going through some wireframe prototyping exercises, I produced a series of mocks in Sketch that could be used to produce a real application. The mocks that were produced followed a style guide that was given in class.

The [full project](https://invis.io/GPBF85DNH) can be seen on invision.
