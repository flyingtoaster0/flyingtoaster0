Since December, a lot has happened with regards to the keyboard. Mostly bad things. I'll do my best to summarize everything here.

## Assembling The Keyboard

First up:

The PCB arrived, and it looked beautiful.

Given that this board contains a lot of tiny components, some of which I cannot solder by hand, I decided to order a PCB stencil. The stencil would allow me to apply solder paste to the PCB's pads accurately. I could then cook the board on the stove to melt the solder and set the components.

Here's what the stencil looked like.

Here is the stencil aligned to the board's pads. I used a very precise method called "taping them together".

After that, I had to smear some solder paste on the holes in the stencil.

The paste applied quite nicely. There were a few areas where paste was touching in adjacent pads, but solder paste tends to get "sucked" onto copper pads when melted, so I felt this should be alright.

After placing all the components, I heated up the frying pan.

One thing I failed to foresee is that a frying pan, unlike a skillet, is not flat; this means that the board was heated unevenly. I had to move the board around a little bit in order to get all the paste to melt, but in the end, it looked alright.

It looked nice, but did not work at all. When I plugged it in, nothing happened at all. Inspecting the board more closely, I found that there were a bunch of shorts on the microcontroller, so I heated up my iron, got some soldering wick, and tried to clean things up a little bit. The problem is that after a certain amount of heating, soldering, and solder removing, PCB pads tend to strip off, rendering the board useless. It's not always possible to fix these problems.

After prodding around with a multimeter, removing and reattaching the microcontroller, and several other components I realized that there were two pins that weren't attached on the microcontroller, but we're supposed to. At one point, I even got rid of some surface mount components, and soldered through hole components onto the board, just in case.

I ended up with this monster:

Eventually I managed to get a board to be recognized by my computer, but it had other problems:

In the end, I'm pretty sure I fried about four microcontrollers from shorts or heating them too much when trying to fix shorts. Assembling the board myself wasn't working out.

## Another Way

It became apparent to me that a lot of my problems were brought on by not owning professional soldering equipment. I figured I would just have the board fabricated and assembled for me instead.

I found a service called MacroFab which does exactly what I wanted. They even source their components from Digi-Key, so I went with them.

After about a month and a half, I got my board. I checked the connections, and they all looked great! Even the tiny ones.

There was just one problem with this board.

![Red PCB no holes](/assets/numpad_keyboard/a_series_of_failures/red_pcb.jpg)

Where the hell are all the holes?! 

All those copper circles are supposed to have holes in them. This means that even if the board *did* work, that I wouldn't be able to put switches on it.

This also meant that this board had no vias. Vias are really small holes in the board that allow copper traces to go from one side of the board to the other. Because this board was missing all copper drill holes, there were no vias, which meant that I couldn't even test to see if the my computer would recognize the board to begin with.

Useless.

The problem was actually in how I submitted my design files to this MacroFab, so I fixed that up, and sent them over.

After another month and a bit, I got a new board. I tried plugging it in... nothing. Again, in another port... nothing.

Hm. Maybe I'll try a different USB cable.

There are no words.

The USB plug came right off the board.

Luckily, MacroFab was really nice about the refund.

## Lessons

Six months later, and I still don't have a working keyboard. On the plus side though, there were some lessons learned through this.

### ***I don't own professional soldering equipment***

This made it really hard to even get components soldered in the first place. Even if my PCB was designed properly, I was very likely to mess something up even by just assembling it.

### ***A month and a half is too long to wait for a prototype***

Once I decided that I wouldn't assemble the board myself, I tried ordering it fully assembled. If the turnaround time could have been reduced to two or three weeks, this would have actually been the best option. Waiting over six weeks just to check my work is too much.

## Next Steps

I'm not done yet. I'm doing to try a different approach that should address the two above problems. I'll updateâ€‹ soon.
