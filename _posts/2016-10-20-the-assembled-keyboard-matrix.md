OSH Park delivered the boards for keyboard matrix!

I was a little concerned about my soldering, but the tiny diodes went on just fine; I didn't have to rework anything.

After hooking it up to the Pro Micro, everything worked just fine; Text was getting typed and the LED was working too.

Here it is with some keycaps on it.

I actually think that the switches might be a little too far from each other - a millimetre at most. When laying out the components for the numpad, I may see if I can find a design for a keyboard somewhere to double check my spacing.

This was pretty simple, but I'm a little concerned about the microcontroller breakout board. The breakout board has more components and more hard-to-solder components. I'll update again in about two weeks when that board comes.
