Working with Loblaw Companies Limited on the Android version of their PC Plus app, I had the opportunity to co-lead multiple discovery and framings to scope out new features. As the lead Android developer on the team, I determined technical feasibility of proposed features and pair programmed with other developers to implement them. By the end of the engagement, we implemented a number of delightful features, such as the onboarding flow or the ability to save offers for the following week.


The PC Plus app has since been re-released as the PC Optimum app, [available on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sap.mdc.loblaw.nativ).
