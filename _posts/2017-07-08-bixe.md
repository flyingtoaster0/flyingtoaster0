Bixe (pronounced "bikes") is an Android app I made when I was a user of Toronto Bike Share. The app loads bike station data from a JSON api and displays it on a map view. The user can then select a pin on the map to see how many bikes, and available docks that station has. The network layer of the app was built using RxJava and Retrofit.

Bixe's source code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/flyingtoaster0/Bixe).
