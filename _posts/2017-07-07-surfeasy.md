In a small agile development team, I was responsible for SurfEasy\'s Android and iOS apps. Working iteratively with our product designer, we developed an experience that felt both consistent and natural on both platforms. I also mentored two co-op students while at SurfEasy.

The app provides end-to-end encryption of web traffic, as well as ad tracker blocking.
